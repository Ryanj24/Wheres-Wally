# Where's Wally

This project is a full stack photo tagging application with a theme centered around the popular puzzle books Where's Wally (Where's Waldo in the USA). The project was developed using mostly React and basic CSS for the font-end styling logic and routing whilst utilising Firebase for the back-end data storage.
